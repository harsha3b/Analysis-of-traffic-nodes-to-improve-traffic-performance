# Simulation_Project
A traffic analysis and simulation of a traffic junction.
Traffic problems exist everywhere in the world. To improve the traffic situation of any particular place incurs a lot of
costs - both time and money. This is where simulation comes in. Simulating the traffic system helps us design the
model and test it against different scenarios. The resources used are far less than actually implementing real-world
changes and it also gives us the ability to predict how things might change with any particular idea.
Our team worked towards improving the traffic performance of the node assigned to us - Wilhelmst√§dter Platz, Stadtfeld Ost,
Magdeburg. 
# The steps followed are:
# 1) Develop a conceptual model of the street
# 2) Collection of data for analysis and validation purposes
# 3) Data analysis of the data sets 
# 4) Simulating the traffic node in Anylogic software
# 5) Validation of the simulation program based on the data collected
# 6) Different experimental scenarios and their performances
# 7) Results
