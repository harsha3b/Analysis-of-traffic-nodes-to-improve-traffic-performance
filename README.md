# Simulation_Project
A traffic analysis and simulation of a traffic junction.
Traffic problems exist everywhere in the world. To improve the traffic situation of any particular place, incurs a lot of
cost - both time and money. This is where simulation comes in. Simulating the traffic system helps us design the
model and test it against different scenarios. The resources used are far less than actually implementing real-world
changes and it also gives us the ability to predict how things might change with any particular idea. Our team worked
towards improving the traffic performance of the node assigned to us - Wilhelmst√§dter Platz, Stadtfeld Ost,
Magdeburg. This report will walk you through our approach to this project. It includes an insight into our conceptual
model and our approach to transform given and collected data into knowledge. It also takes a look at the simulation
model that was created using the knowledge and conceptual model. It then continues to explain our approach
towards validating the model along with four experiments that would be conducted to test traffic performance
improvement. This report then concludes analysing the results of the experiment and our recommendation based on
different key indicators.
